# LightsOut In Phoenix Framework
Lights Out is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to turn off all the lights on a grid. Clicking a cell toggles its state (on/off) as well as the states of its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). This project implements the game using the Phoenix Framework for the backend and frontend, leveraging Elixir for its functional programming capabilities and robust concurrency features.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
